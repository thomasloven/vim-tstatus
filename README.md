vim-tstatus
===========

I decided to move my status line out into a plugin for vim.

If you want to use it, I recommend that you switch your terminal colors to solarized.

Please note that this is unfinished and unstable. There is no caching and everything gets messed up if you change your colorscheme.

You should be able to install this plugin using [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).

I got a lot of inspiration and some code from [Vim Powerline](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline).

I would not have been able to do this without [Learn Vimscript the Hard Way by Steve Losh](http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/).
